Assignment: C-- Interpreter Project

Instructions:

1)Download the provided header (.h) files: interpreter.h, arithmetic.h, condition.h, print.h, and variable.h. You can modify these files. 

2)Write the missing source (.c) files for each header file to complete the project. You will need to implement the functions defined in the headers.

3)Use the provided main.c file as the entry point for your program. It already contains a sample C-- code that you should be able to execute correctly once your interpreter is complete.

4)Test your interpreter thoroughly with different C-- code snippets to ensure it handles variable assignment, arithmetic operations, conditionals, and printing as described in the provided C-- code.

5)Submit the complete project, including all source (.c) and header (.h) files, as a compressed archive (e.g., .zip or .tar.gz).
